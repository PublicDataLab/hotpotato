It is also proposed that by 2020 the ULEZ is expanded Londonwide for heavy vehicles, which will result in only an estimated 1 per cent of road length in Outer London remaining in exceedance of the NO2 limit values after 2020: primarily on the North Circular and around Heathrow (which is a matter for national policy). The expansion of the ULEZ for light vehicles to Outer London would affect an additional circa 1.7 million households. It is likely that targeted local measures such as local road closures, vehicle restrictions or other interventions could be equally effective and as likely to bring this remaining 1 per cent of road length into compliance, and in a quicker timeframe.
